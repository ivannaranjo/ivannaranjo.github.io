I really had two starts on my career. The first start was my internship in a
Spanish company producing a big software system using Smalltalk. That lasted for
a full year and was a great introduction as to how being a software developer in
Spain was all about. The most terrifying consequence was that to go up the
ladder you had to give up your technical side, there was no other way. So I
moved on.

I was incredibly fortunate to get an offer from Microsoft in Redmond, so I
jumped ship. I left Spain, where my friends and familiy were and decided to go
on.

My first job at Microsoft was at the QFE (**Q**uick **F**ix **E**ngineering)
team in Office, and mostly working in Word 97 to begin with. When I arrived they
had just shipped [Office 97 SR1][1] and were in a relative low key period in
between SR releases and planning the next release [Office 2000][2].

My role really was to debug the issues reported by enterprise agreement
customers, produce a suitable fix that would not break the product and move on
to the next bug.
